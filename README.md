This is a repo containing the **core files** for my daily driver laptop. I'm currently running *Fedora Workstation 42* with *Hyprland*, however this is subject to change. These are the main applications I use to create my desktop environment.



### *INTRO*

The main idea of this is to be a functional, no nonsense daily driver capable of aiding me in my daily work. This is meant to run in tandem[^1] with my PC, which has its own dedicated repo for parity. Everything in this repo is built and configured for my **ASUS ZenBook.** Specifics can be found below. 

<p1>
It should go without mentioning that I do most of my coding and work on my laptop, so lots of commits.

Because of this, the **JUNO** repo will be an ongoing project.

### *INSTALLATION*

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**  
> After downloading, you *must* modify the relative config files to point to your own directories for *images, wallpapers, icons,* etc. Not everything works right out of the box right now.

###### Clone repository

```bash

git clone https://github.com/hologramkrypt/juno.git
cd juno

```

### Notes on configuring the system

I have provided in depth information for installing and configuring the system within [the Installation README](github/INSTALL.md). I have also provided alternatives, however substituting dependencies is highly discouraged. I would advise against changing much form the base repository structure.

Information on what I use for my wallpapers, icons, etc can be found in the [assets README](github/ASSETS.md)

### *TO-DO*

- [ ] Installation walkthrough
- [ ] Wallust integration throughout applications
- [ ] Connectivity between programs
- [ ] Theming
- [ ] Github beautification

### *ATTRIBUTIONS*

This build was inspired in part by [JaKooLit's Hyprland Dots](https://github.com/JaKooLit/Hyprland-Dots), which I found to be a very sturdy framework to build upon. I also would like to give credit to [ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen), who's Nvim config I largely based my own config on.


[^1]: I try to make both of these systems work together as much as possible. For example, I use the same Nvim config on both.
