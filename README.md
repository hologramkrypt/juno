<h1 align=center>JUNO</h1>


<h4 align=center>🚧THIS IS UNDER MAITENANCE 🚧</h4>

This is a repo containing the **core files** for my daily driver laptop. I'm currently running *Fedora Workstation 42* with *Hyprland*, however this is subject to change. These are the main applications I use to create my desktop enviorment.

### *INTRO*

The main idea of this is to be a functional, no nonsense daily driver capable of aiding me in my daily work. This is meant to run in tandem[^1] with my PC, which has its own dedicated repo for parity. Everything in this repo is built and configured for my **ASUS ZenBook.** Specifics can be found below. 

<p1>
It should go without mentioning that I do most of my coding and work on my laptop, so lots of commits.

Because of this, the **JUNO** repo will be an ongoing project.
