This repository contains the **core files** for my daily driver laptop.

### *Intro*

The main idea is to have a functional, no-nonsense daily driver capable of aiding me in my daily work.  
This runs in tandem[^1] with my PC, which has its own dedicated repo for parity.  
Everything here is configured for my **ASUS ZenBook**. Specifics below.

> I do most of my coding and work on my laptop, so lots of commits.  
> The **JUNO** repo will be an ongoing project.
